HoopsPi
========

A demo showing how to use a Raspberry Pi, ultrasonic sensor and WebSockets to create a scoreboard for a basketball hoop (or any other device which counts when it sees movement!). It was created for an article over at https://www.sitepoint.com!

If you make something fancy from this code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at https://www.devdiner.com.
